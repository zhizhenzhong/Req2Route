Abstract: The global communication networks are supported by high-capacity lightpaths provisioned over large-scale optical fiber networks. Such networks are composed of multiple heterogeneous autonomous system (AS) domains dominated by different countries, organizations, and companies spanning thousands of kilometers. The distributed and autonomous nature of multi- domain networks makes it difficult to obtain a global route for inter-domain service request as domain information is strictly hidden and protected for commercial and security considerations. In this study, we go beyond conventional methods by introducing the deep-learning-based Request-to-Route (Req2Route) routing engine. We model the inter-domain routing problem as a generalized sequence-to-sequence learning task, and solve it by using long short-term memory (LSTM). We find that, with the help of LSTM, the Req2Route engine can learn inherent relationships among network nodes from historical routes, and directly return feasible inter-domain service route under current network state. Numerical results show that the Req2Route engine can significantly reduce service setup latency and control signaling message load, without blocking performance compromise compared with the conventional method. We believe that the Req2Route engine provides a paradigm shift from conventional human-involved algorithm-based control to next-generation agile and autonomous network management.
