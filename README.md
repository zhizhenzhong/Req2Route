Abstract: We first propose a novel multi-domain routing paradigm that transforms the routing problem from heuristic-algorithm-based computation to artificial-intelligence-based data analytics. Numerical results prove that our proposal can achieve excellent routing accuracy, and significant signaling reduction.
